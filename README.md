Add a short description of the intended behavior, how the game mechanic should work. I need to know what were you trying to achieve.
The game is a side-scroller game. Your goal is to get more coins then your the other player.

!I had no time to fix two thing!
1. Point all go to player 1.
2. UI does not dissapear on game end.

Add a short set of instructions for me, as a developer, about what do I need do to in order to take a look at your project - what scene I need to load in order to play? Do I need any additional packages to install?
No packages used. To start load scene MainMenu, them you can start.

Describe quickly the structure of your code and the thinking behind design.
I tried to separate code that was not relevant in each specefic script to a seprate script on the same objekt.

Add a short list if instructions about how to play the game like, for example, the key mappings and what do they do
There is two player, you controlle the players with wasd and upp, left, down and right keys respectively.
